Storage Services Practice 
1.1.1 About This Exercise 
EVS provides persistent block storage for ECSs and BMSs. With data redundancy and cache accel
 eration techniques, EVS disks deliver high availability and durability as well as stable, low latency. 
You can initialize EVS disks, create file systems on them, and store data persistently on them. This 
exercise describes basic EVS operations, such as purchasing and attaching EVS disks.
